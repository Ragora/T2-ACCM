You can legally obtain a Tribes 2 installer and multiplayer patch from the [TribesNext](http://tribesnext.com/) 
website.

If you have a working installation, you may click the "Download ZIP" button on this page to obtain a zipped version
of the modification. You must then create a folder called "accm" in the GameData folder of your Tribes 2 installation
and extract the contents of the ZIP here. After this, you simply run the game with the "-mod accm" parameter:

Tribes2.exe -online -mod accm

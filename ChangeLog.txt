* DarkDragonDX takes up development.
* Fixed saving of objects with names set via /name
	- Names of switches and generators now save albeit they need toggled first.
* Removed a bunch of Sentinel Stuff (by Blnukem) -- their AI was never actually finished it seemed.

* Several occurances of console spam were fixed.
* Removed unused files, reorganized files slightly.
* Added Linux shell script for deleting .dso files if you're weird like me and run on some Linux operating system via WINE.
* Team 6 is now the 'offical zombie team'. This just means zombie targets are set to this by default.

* Edited /changeName so that color sequences are accepted
	\c0 - Very Dark Blue-ish color
	\c1 - Bright Green in chat window / Cyan in Lobby
	\c2 - Faded Orange in Chat / Gray in Lobby
	\c3 - Bright Green in chat / Dark Green in Lobby

	\c5 - Gold in Chat / White in Lobby (Bright)
	\c6 - Blue in Chat (Normal) / White in Lobby (Normal)
	\c7 - Blue in Chat (Normal) / Gold in Lobby
	\c8 - Blue in Chat (Normal) / Blue In Lobby (smurf color)
	\c9 - Blue in Chat (Normal) / Green in Lobby (Bot)
	- Ex: /changename dx \cp\c7[Faction]\c6Name\co
	- Also any standard ASCII junk is supported as well -- figure it out yourself.

ACCM Advanced Help/Chat Command list.

Command Tutorial:

When you see anything similar to: "[SomeMessage]" next to a chat command, that means it is required to type after the chat command in order for the command to work.
For example, the first command on this list, /CreateSquad [Name], requires you to type a Name for the squad after typing /CreateSquad.
Example: /CreateSquad Rouges - This will create a squad called "Rouges"

There may be specified options that you MUST choose from, for example, the command /DroneBattle has many options. The most useful is that you can customize the battles.
The command looks something like this: /DroneBattle [Single/Battle/Custom], you need to choose one of those variables that are divided by a "/" by simply typing it after the command.

There are times where the variables are told while you are typing the command, and are not specified in the /help command. For example, if you just type: /DroneBattle Custom, an error
message will appear telling you to type the radius for the drones to spawn, this same thing can also occur with zombie commands as well, and it can occur multiple times in a command.
If this comes up, don't worry, it's perfectly normal. You just need to type the varible the command is requesting. 
If you type /DroneBattle Custom this exact message will pop up: "Please specify the spawn radius. Radius cannot be lower than 500 meters." This means you need to specify the radius by 
typing: /DroneBattle Custom 500 (Or higher than 500 if you choose) then after you type that, another message will appear requesting another variable. So if a command is asking you to type
a variable, there is nothing wrong with the command, it's just asking to be completed.

Now you understand the basics of ACCM chat commands, if you are still unsure about something, ask a mod developer.
